# Welcome to My Zsh
My Zsh

## Task
Zsh - tcsh - bash - sh are command interpreters. A command interpreter is run inside a terminal.
What is a UNIX command interpreter?
If we have to make it simple: It's a loop.

## Description
Only basic command lines are expected to be executed; no pipes, redirections or any other advanced features.
 The executables should be those found in the path, as indicated in the PATH variable.
If the executable cannot be found, you must display an error message and display the prompt again.
Errors must be dealt with and must display the appropriate message on the error output. You must
 correctly handle the PATH and the environment (by copying and restoring the initial env).

## Installation
no Installation. We run the programm with gcc and make command.
